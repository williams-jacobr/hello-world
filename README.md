# hello-world

I'm finally falling into the world of code after years of delay. When I was leaving school I was going
to be a big programmer for a top gaming company but a course at university later and I had broadened my
horizons too far, too many things to do and not enough time to commit to my earlier dreams. As I begin
to settle down I am returning to my equilibrium.
